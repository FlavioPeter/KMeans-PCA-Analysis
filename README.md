# KMeans-PCA-Analysis
This project demonstrate some utilities of these algorithms:  KMeans: For comparing clusters before and after the algorithm was used for the same number of labels it had originally... With the help of PCA to visualize those clusters. KNeighbors is also used to study the model improvement before and after Scale and PCA pre-processings The BreastCancer and Iris datasets from sklearn are used in the study:  Conversion to Pandas DataFrame for convenience Scaling to minimize ranges variations between features
